# Why Choose Mango X
A small portion of free roblox exploit look good, but when you donwload them you have to go through ads that have a butt ton of virus. Then the key system also has ads which have viruses. Also, by the time you enter the key, the key will be expired. But, Mango X doesnt have any of that. None of that crap.
